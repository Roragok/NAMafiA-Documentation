# Forum Mafia Rules

Hello there! Welcome to the world of Forum Mafia!

If you are new to Mafia, I suggest you read our New Player Guide. *TODO*

What follows is a list of rules to add structure to our Mafia games.

## Rules

1. Roles will be decided after sign-ups. Each role is guaranteed to be determined randomly. The host will assign roles by giving each person a number and using random.org.  If you get a role you don’t like, too bad.  ***TODO*** **Working on an app that will live on mafia.namafia.com that will facilitate this process.**
2. If you want to play, you must be active. This means a commitment of not only reading but replying to the game thread. If you are not considered active you may be mod killed or replaced.  Our active posters average around 10-20 posts per day, but often times this will require significantly more.
3. You may not collaborate with other players outside of this thread through PM, IRC, AIM, other forums threads, etc. This is on the honor system. The game is ruined if you cheat. Anyone who is found collaborating with other players will not only be banned from future Mafia games, but will also receive a permanent ban from the forums. Cheating is a waste of everyone’s time.
