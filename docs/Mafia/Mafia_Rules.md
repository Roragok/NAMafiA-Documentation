# Forum Mafia Rules

Hello there! Welcome to the world of Forum Mafia!

If you are new to Mafia, I suggest you read our New Player Guide. *TODO*

What follows is a list of rules to add structure to our Mafia games.

## Host Rules
The rules in this section are more for the host to set up a structured game.

1. Roles will be decided after sign-ups. Each role is guaranteed to be determined randomly. The host will assign roles by giving each person a number and using [random.org](random.org).  If you get a role you donâ€™t like, too bad.  ***TODO*** **Working on an app that will live on mafia.namafia.com that will facilitate this process.**

2. Night Action Resolution will be resolved in this manner: [Night Action Orderr](https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Natural_Action_Resolution/Normal_Game).


## Player Rules
1. You may not discuss any active mafia game outside the game thread, without the express permission of the Host.  Depending on the severity you will be mod killed and potentially banned from future games. This includes but is not limited to:
  * the forum itself
  * private messages
  * skype
  * discord
  * you get the idea.  

The exceptions would be mafia or mason chat that the host has setup, and is aware of.

2. When voting to lynch a player, you must place the lynch in bold for it to count.  A lynch not bolded will not be counted. Do not use bold text unless you are voting

3. There is no talking at night, period. Dead people cannot talk, period. If you break these rules, you will be banned from the next mafia game.

4. The host may change any rule in the game.  If that is the case, the host must specify the changed rules.


## Game Guidelines
These are more generic guidelines that are often changed on a game by game basis.

1. If you want to play, you must be active. This means a commitment of not only reading but replying to the game thread. If you are not considered active you may be mod killed or replaced.  Our active posters average around 10-20 posts per day, but often times this will require significantly more.

2. Day voting lasts 48 hours. At the end of 48 hours, the plurality vote will be upheld. Night rounds end either once all applicable power roles have reported in or when 24 hours have passed, whichever comes first. If you are a power role and do not submit your night action before the night round ends, you will be banned from the next game.  As the game progresses day and night may shrink to speed up play with fewer numbers.

3. Once the game starts, the host will not answer questions that are asked in the game thread. If you ever have a question during the game, you can PM the host to make sure you are not breaking any rules/understand how the game works. If the host feels that the answer will be helpful to everyone playing (purely to understand the mechanics of the game, not to affect the outcome), the host can post it for everyone to see, so nobody will know who originally asked the question.
