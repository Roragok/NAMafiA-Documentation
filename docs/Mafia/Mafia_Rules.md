# Forum Mafia Rules

Hello there! Welcome to the world of Forum Mafia!

If you are new to Mafia, I suggest you read our New Player Guide. *TODO*

What follows is a list of rules to add structure to our Mafia games.

## Rules

1. Roles will be decided after sign-ups. Each role is guaranteed to be determined randomly. The host will assign roles by giving each person a number and using [random.org](random.org).  If you get a role you don’t like, too bad.  ***TODO*** **Working on an app that will live on mafia.namafia.com that will facilitate this process.**

2. If you want to play, you must be active. This means a commitment of not only reading but replying to the game thread. If you are not considered active you may be mod killed or replaced.  Our active posters average around 10-20 posts per day, but often times this will require significantly more.

3. You may not collaborate with other players outside of this thread through PM, IRC, AIM, other forums threads, etc. This is on the honor system. The game is ruined if you cheat. Anyone who is found collaborating with other players will not only be banned from future Mafia games, but will also receive a permanent ban from the forums. Cheating is a waste of everyone’s time.

4. Day voting lasts 48 hours. At the end of 48 hours, the plurality vote will be upheld. Night rounds end either once all applicable power roles have reported in or when 24 hours have passed, whichever comes first. If you are a power role and do not submit your night action before the night round ends, you will be banned from the next game.

5. In the case of ties for plurality, the host will roll a die to determine the lynch case. Assign each player a number that is tied and roll a dice.  Whoever's number is rolled is lynched.  @discobot roll 1d[tied players].  i.e @discobot roll 1d2

6. Night action order of precedence: Roleblocker > Jailkeeper > Tracker > Watcher > Doctor > Kill. All kills are executed simultaneously. A player who is killing someone while getting killed will still be successful in their kill (resulting in 2 deaths).

7. There is no talking at night, period. Dead people cannot talk, period. If you break these rules, you will be banned from the next mafia game.

8. No screenshots of [NAMafiA](namafia.com) will be allowed.  You will be warned first, then mod killed.

9. When voting to lynch a player, you must place the lynch in bold for it to count.  A lynch not bolded will not be counted.

10. Once the game starts, the host will not answer questions that are asked in the game thread. If you ever have a question during the game, you can PM the host to make sure you are not breaking any rules/understand how the game works. If the host feels that the answer will be helpful to everyone playing (purely to understand the mechanics of the game, not to affect the outcome), the host can post it for everyone to see, so nobody will know who originally asked the question.

11.  Reactions and liking are not allowed.  You will be warned first. Then mod killed.

12.  The host may change any rule in the game as it fits the game.  If that is the case, the host must specify the changed rules.
